# TensorFlow Developer Course

TensorFlow developer course by Zero to Mastery.
Most of the notebooks in this directory were created in google colab, in some cases I finished them on PyCharm

## Subjects covered so far:
* Fundumentals of progrmming with TensorFlow in [notebook 00](https://github.com/TalCordova/TensorFlow_Course/blob/main/00_tensorflow_fundamentals.ipynb).
* Introduction to regression with TensorFlow in [notebook 01](https://github.com/TalCordova/TensorFlow_Course/blob/main/01_neural_network_regression_with_tensorflow.ipynb).
* Binary and multi-class classification in TensorFlow in [notebook 02](https://github.com/TalCordova/TensorFlow_Course/blob/main/02_neural_network_classification_in_tensorflow.ipynb).
* Convolutional Neural Networks and Computer Vision problems in [notebook 03](https://github.com/TalCordova/TensorFlow_Course/blob/main/03_convolutional_neural_networks_with_tensorflow.ipynb).
  * **Note**: This notebook was finished with PyCharm.
